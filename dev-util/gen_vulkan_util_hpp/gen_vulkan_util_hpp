# Vulkan has a lot of enums and bitflags and things with huge
# numbers of entries. As opposed to exposing these directly in
# our Vulkan API, I think it's nice to wrap them in our own
# types, mainly to insulate us a bit from changes in Vulkan's
# types but also for easier-to-read code on our side. Doing this
# entirely by hand isn't very practical because of how numerous
# these types are and how large some of them are, so this script
# exists to do some of the work automatically.
#
# You can pass this script a path to a `vulkan/vulkan.h` and it
# will generate a C++ header suitable for use as our
# `vulkan_util.hpp`. However, I intend for this script to be used
# "by hand"; I plan to use it by redirecting the results to a
# temporary file and comparing it with the existing
# `vulkan_util.hpp` using a diff tool. We won't really get the
# full benefit of the indirection if we just generate that header
# completely automatically; if Vulkan does change in ways we need
# to react to, we'll want to do that deliberately as part of the
# process of changing our header. Also, some of the functions
# provided by the header provide for getting text representations
# of Vulkan enum and bitflag values, and those can benefit from
# some direct human attention since they're meant for human
# consumption. Of course, if something about the output isn't
# right, edit this script instead of fixing the problem by hand.
#
# This script uses Nokogiri (https://nokogiri.org/) to parse
# `vk.xml`. If you have Ruby installed, you probably also have
# Nokogiri installed, but if not, `gem install nokogiri` should
# install it. In theory we could use Bundler here but I don't
# think Nokogiri has ever broken backwards compatability so right
# now I don't think it's really needed just for that one gem.
