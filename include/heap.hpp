/*!
 * \brief An interface to "graphics memory."
 *
 * A Heap provides an interface to allocate memory on the graphics device, or at
 * least in a way that the graphics device can make use of. In most cases, you
 * won't need to create or manage one directly; you can use the Device interface
 * to allocate memory for e.g. an Image. In many ways it's reasonable to think
 * of this class as an implementation detail of Device.
 *
 * If you do create a Heap directly, note that it doesn't follow RAII; you have
 * to explicitly construct it using construct() and free it using the function
 * free_self(). The Device takes care of this automatically for its memory.
